<p class='poetry'>
Galeem is the light restrained /
<br />
Dharkon the darkness sealed /
<br />
Tabuu's defeat, it shook the worlds /
<br />

<br />
Unity has been vanquished /
<br />
Duality took hold /
<br />
And free broke the Galeem /
<br />

<br />
It struck down the many nations /
<br />
The servant of the eternal one /
<br />
Has come to play God /
<br />

<br />
The godslayer /
<br />
He fled the blinding fire /
<br />
He freed his imprisoned friends /
<br />

<br />
Together they defeated the light /
<br />
Ceases one, so rises the other /
<br />
Dharkon invaded reality /
<br />

<br />
Chief of darkness he /
<br />
Conquer the conquered once more /
<br />

<br />
But like the light /
<br />
Darkness fell to the godslayer /
<br />
His defeat it /
<br />
equaled out the world /
<br />

<br />
Light and darkness, severely wounded /
<br />
Waged war against the godslayer /
<br />
He defeated them both with ease /
<br />

<br />
Light and darkness /
<br />
their fate had been determined /
<br />
Duality defeated by variety /
<br />
They fell to ocean's floor /
<br />

<br />
Restored balance in no-balance /
<br />
The spirits were set free /
<br />
They craved their fresh return /
<br />

<br />
They departed towards heaven /
<br />
Becoming one with the stars /
<br />
they left the ashen world /
<br />
